9，Smith & Nephew，United Kingdom
Product Introduction：
The TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME◊ is an external device for limb correction, lengthening and/or straightening . This external fixator takes advantage of the body's natural ability to grow healthy new bone tissue and gives the surgeon the ability to accurately move bones to their correct precise anatomic alignment. The TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME fits around the limb and is attached to the bone with pins or wires that extend from the rings, through the skin and bone to the other side.

The TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME is a circular, metal frame with two rings that connect with six telescopic struts that can be independently lengthened or shortened relative to the rest of the frame. This allows for six different axes of movement, which gives the TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME the ability to correct even the most difficult congenital deformities and trauma cases.

There are many different medical conditions where use of the TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME is prescribed. The external fixator can be used to correct arm and leg length discrepancies and deformities including:
Injury and trauma including growth plate fractures, malunion , non-union, shortening and deformity due to bone loss.
Congenital limb length discrepancies. These conditions are associated with many birth defects and deformities including a short femur, otherwise known as fibular hemimelia.
Pseudoarthritis in which the bone fails to fuse together such as in a fracture healing site. And hemiatrophy, where the bones of one side of a child's body may grow smaller than the other side.

10，Zimmer Biomet，USA - Indiana
Product Introduction：
The XtraFix External Fixation System allows surgeons to build rigid constructs for long bone and pelvic fractures with few components and steps.

Streamlined Workflow
All pins and instruments are color coded to simplify steps for the surgical team. Each pin, whether it is a 5mm/6mm diameter shank (XtraFix Large 11mm System) or a 4mm diameter shank (XtraFix Small 6mm System), is also sized to reduce overall clamp inventory.

Variable Options for Best Fit
Components are available in a wide selection of pin and bar diameters and lengths. Transitioning from XtraFix Large 11mm to Small 6mm components on the same frame is facilitated by XtraFix Large 11mm Pin-to-Bar Clamps.

Efficiency
Efficiency Multi-Pin Clamps have 2-Bar and 1-Bar jaw attachments built-in to the clamp with the goal of reducing the number of components required to construct a frame. Quick- connect ends are designed into pins and drills to save time during implantation.
All clamps have a SnapLoc latch that actively prevents bars and pins from popping out. Clamps also feature one-nut tightening designed to save time intra-operatively.

System Features
The system is intended to stabilize open or closed long bone fractures. It can also be used for arthrodesis and osteotomies with associated soft tissue problems; stabilization of limbs after removal of total joint implants for infection or other failures; stabilization of non-unions, and as an intraoperative temporary stabilization tool assist with indirect reduction.

The most important functional design goal of an external fixation system is to provide fracture stability.
