Product Introduction：

Anterior cervical plate has been used for the operative treatment of disc degeneration and trauma for several years. With its extensive application, this kind of plate is required to be on a higher level of lower profile and narrower width, in order to minimize its irritation on peripheral tissues, we must ensure the plate to be stabilized firmly, without the screw migration in the long term of activity. Therefore, an antimigration mechanism must be added into cervical plate system. Anterior Cervical Plate system has been designed to answer the growing need for a lower profile and stiff plate, more importantly, offering the self-locking mechanism to reduce the surgical steps and time for the facilitation of surgery. It also provides two kinds of screws for different operations.

TC20: New Material Without Vanadium Trouble

Materials: TC20 Full Name: Ti6Al7Nb
It is a new type of implant material with high technology content and high economic value. Standards implemented in different countries and regions include: ISO5832-11, ASTM F1295, GB/T13810, GB 23102.

Differences between TC20 and TC4
TC20 (Ti6Al7Nb) and TC4(Ti-6Al-4V) belong to alpha + beta-titanium alloy. The main difference is that TC20 uses the non-toxic element niobium (Nb) instead of the toxic element vanadium (V) in TC4.

Advantage of Difference
1. The potential cytotoxicity of element V is eliminated and the material has good cytocompatibility.
2. Nb element can promote the density increase of passivation film formed by surface oxidation of ti-6al-7nb alloy, so that the material has good corrosion resistance.
3. The oxides and hydroxides of titanium, aluminum and niobium have reached saturation, and the dissolved metals in the implants will not be ionized or transferred in the body, making them have good biocompatibility.
Applications:hand phalange, metacarpal, wrist
Locking:locking

Product Introduction：
Anterior Cervical system consists of mobile emergency screws, fixed emergency screw, plate which provides high strength with low thickness, screws of mobile and fixed bone anchorage.

Blocking system that avoids the anteropulsion of screws, is friendly and effective with the plate. The mobile emergency screws allow poliaxial angulation of 15°. The fixed emergency screws are placed perpendicularly to the plate in order to obtain more solid fixings. The ionically anodized surface avoids friction wearing out and boosts resistance lo fatigue. The rounded peripheral rim lowers the aggressiveness of the implant over soft tissues. It provides effective and simple use.

Is based on a comprehensive, clinically proven design, modified to incorporate current market technology and offers maximum implant versatility & integrated instrumentation.

Characteristics
From a surgical perspective, the plate allows for an easy posterolateral approach to the upper ankle joint and subtalar joint without affecting any major anatomical structures, less impairment of wound-healing
Both joints can be approached via one incision, no alteration of plantar soft tissue
Optimum control of the axial heel when the patient is in a prone position with a possible extension in terms of posterior preparation
Excellent compression of the arthrodesis space thanks to traction screws, optimum fixation by means of locking screws in the tibia, talus and calcaneus

Material
Plates titanium ISO 5832-2
Screws Ti6Al4V ISO 5832-3

Contraindications
Contraindications exist in the case of acute infections that could hinder the healing process due
to the implants used, far-advanced osteoporosis, severe circulatory disorders and known allergies
to surgical implant materials. There are restrictions with patients with open growth plates and the
possibility of conservative treatment methods. The surgeon must provide clarifi cation of the risks;
it is his responsibility to do so.
The patient who receives this implant must be advised by the surgeon that the safety and lifespan
of the implant are dependent on the following factors and risks:
» Previous infections
» Overweight of the patient
» Extreme stress to be expected due to work and sport

Product Introduction：
ASCOT
Anterior Cervical Stabilization
Semi-rigid design with large angle variability
Lockable, self-drilling screws
Low profile plate design of 1.8 mm
A cervical plating system must provide the cervical spine C2 - C7 with the necessary stability, while the formation of a solid bone fusion takes place. At the same time the system is being unobtrusively integrated into the biomechanical system of the cervical spine. ASCOT achieves the balance between maximized stability and minimized stiffness and thus allows for load-sharing with the bone to facilitate segmental fusion (Wolff’s law).

With angular variability in its semi-rigid screw/plate connection ASCOT is able to adapt to the changing anatomic situation over the course of the healing process. The integrated locking mechanism and self-drilling screws enable
one-step screw placement and locking resulting in a system that is efficient to handle and safe for the patient.
ASCOT® offers the user a high degree of flexibility in anterior stabilization from C2 to C7. Pre-lordosed plates are available in different lenghts for one to four segment constructs. The self-drilling variable angle screws are available in different lengths and diameters. With an ample 10° of angular variability, ASCOT® is applicable in a wide variety of anatomic situations. Due to the automatic locking mechanism, no additional surgical steps are necessary and guarantees a safe protection against postoperative screw migration. At 1.8mm thick ASCOT® is one of the thinnest cervical plates on the market.
Applications：cervical
Locking：locking
